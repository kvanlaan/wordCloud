# wordCloud
My 3rd program for Intro to Data Structures at University of Wisconsin. This program creates a word cloud from a text file. A word cloud is a way to visually represent information in a text file; key words from the text file are listed alphabetically with the importance of each word indicated by font size and/or color.  Key words are any words that show up in the text file that are not in a provided list of words to ignore. The importance of a word is determined by how many times the word appears in the text file. The word cloud created from the text file will be saved to a webpage. The program takes four command-line arguments: the name of the input text file, the name of the output file (i.e., the webpage), the maximum number of words to include in the word cloud, and the name of the text file containing the words to ignore. Java.

Use gettysburg.txt for sample input text.
See gettysbur.20.html for sample output file.
Works best if opened in Eclipse.
